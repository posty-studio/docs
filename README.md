# Tibbie Docs

Documentation for Tibbie, a social media scheduling and automation platform.

## Development

Install the CLI to preview documentation changes locally:

```
npm i -g mint
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation, where your `docs.json` is located:

```
mint dev
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Publishing changes

Changes are deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

## Troubleshooting

- If your dev environment isn't running: Run `mint update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI.
- If a page loads as a 404: Make sure you are running in a folder with a valid `docs.json`.
