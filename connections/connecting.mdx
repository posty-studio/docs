To publish posts, you need to connect at least one social media account to Tibbie.

## Supported platforms

| X (Twitter) | Available |

## Connecting via the web app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Connections">
    Navigate to the **Connections** page from the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a platform">
    Click **Connect account** and choose a platform (e.g. X).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Tibbie">
    You'll be redirected to the platform's authorization page. Grant Tibbie permission to read and write posts on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    After authorizing, you're redirected back to Tibbie. Your account appears in the connections list and is ready for publishing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connecting via the CLI or API

You can also connect accounts through the [CLI](/cli/getting-started) or [REST API](/api-reference):

1. Call `POST /connections/connect/{platform}` to get an authorization URL and a state token
2. Open the authorization URL in a browser and approve access
3. Poll `GET /connections/connect/{platform}/status/{stateToken}` until the status is `completed`

The authorization URL expires after **10 minutes**.

## Permissions

When you connect an X account, Tibbie requests the following permissions:

- **Read tweets** — to verify publishing success
- **Write tweets** — to publish posts on your behalf
- **Upload media** — to attach images and videos
- **Read profile** — to display your account name and avatar
- **Offline access** — to refresh tokens automatically

## Account limits

The number of accounts you can connect depends on your plan:

| Plan | Connected accounts |
|---|---|
| Starter | 10 |
| Growth | 20 |
