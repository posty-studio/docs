You can disconnect a social account at any time from the **Connections** page.

## How to disconnect

Go to **Connections**, find the account, and click **Disconnect**. The account is deactivated immediately.

## What happens to your posts

- **Published posts** remain on the social platform. Tibbie does not delete previously published content.
- **Scheduled posts** targeting only the disconnected account will fail when their publish time arrives.
- **Scheduled posts** targeting multiple accounts will still publish to the remaining connected accounts.

<Warning>
  Before disconnecting, check if you have any scheduled posts targeting this account. Edit those posts to remove the account or reschedule them.
</Warning>

## Reconnecting later

If you disconnect and later reconnect the same social account, it appears as a new connection. You'll need to update any draft or scheduled posts to target the new connection.
