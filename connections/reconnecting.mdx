Connections can sometimes lose access when tokens expire or are revoked. When this happens, Tibbie marks the account as needing reconnection.

## Why connections need reconnecting

A connection may need reconnecting when:

- **Token expired** — OAuth tokens have a limited lifetime. Tibbie refreshes them automatically, but this can fail if the token has been inactive for too long.
- **Access revoked** — you revoked Tibbie's access from the platform's settings (e.g. X's "Connected apps" page).
- **Password changed** — some platforms invalidate OAuth tokens when you change your password.

## How to reconnect

When an account needs reconnecting, you'll see a warning indicator on the **Connections** page.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Connections">
    Navigate to the **Connections** page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click reconnect">
    Find the account with the warning and click **Reconnect**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-authorize">
    Complete the OAuth flow again to grant Tibbie fresh access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Impact on scheduled posts

While an account needs reconnecting, any posts targeting that account will fail to publish. Reconnect the account, then retry the failed posts or reschedule them.
