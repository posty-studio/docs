The Tibbie API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and platform stability.

## Limits

| Endpoint | Limit |
|---|---|
| All endpoints | 60 requests per minute |
| `POST /media` | 30 requests per minute |

Rate limits are applied per authenticated user. If you're not authenticated, limits are applied per IP address.

## Response headers

Every API response includes headers to help you track your current rate limit usage:

| Header | Description |
|---|---|
| `x-ratelimit-limit` | The maximum number of requests allowed per minute. |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current window. |

```
x-ratelimit-limit: 60
x-ratelimit-remaining: 59
```

## Handling rate limits

When you exceed a rate limit, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Wait for the limit to reset before retrying.

```json
{
  "message": "Too Many Attempts."
}
```

<Tip>
  Space out your requests to stay within limits. For bulk operations, add a short delay between requests.
