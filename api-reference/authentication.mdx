description: "Authenticate with the Tibbie API using Bearer tokens."

The Tibbie API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your API token in the `Authorization` header of every request.

```bash
curl https://tibbie.co/api/v1/user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Creating an API token

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Access tokens">
    Navigate to **Settings** > **Access tokens** in your Tibbie dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a token">
    Click **Create token** and give it a name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the token">
    Your token is displayed once. Copy it and store it securely — you won't be able to see it again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

API tokens are prefixed with `sk_` and have full access to your account. You can create up to **10 API tokens**.

## Revoking a token

Go to **Settings** > **Access tokens** and delete any token you no longer need. Revoked tokens stop working immediately.

## Error responses

If your token is missing or invalid, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "message": "Unauthenticated."
}
```
