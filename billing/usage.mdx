## Post usage

Your post count includes every platform entry — each connected account a post targets counts as one post.

For example, a single post published to two X accounts counts as **2 posts** toward your limit.

The following count toward your usage:
- Posts that have been **published**
- Posts that are currently **scheduled** or **publishing**

**Drafts** do not count toward your limit.

## What happens at the limit

On the **Starter** plan, when you reach 200 posts in a billing period:

- You cannot publish new posts or schedule posts for the current period
- Existing scheduled posts will still publish as planned
- Your usage resets at the start of your next billing period

Upgrade to the **Growth** plan for unlimited posts.

## Connected account limits

| Plan | Limit |
|---|---|
| Starter | 10 accounts |
| Growth | 20 accounts |

When you reach your account limit, you need to disconnect an existing account before connecting a new one. Disconnecting an account does not affect previously published posts.
