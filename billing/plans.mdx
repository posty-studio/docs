Tibbie offers two plans, billed monthly per team.

## Plans

| | Starter | Growth |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | $12/month | $29/month |
| **Posts** | 200 per billing period | Unlimited |
| **Connected accounts** | 10 | 20 |

## What counts as a post

Post usage is counted per platform, not per post. If you create one post targeting 3 connected accounts, that counts as 3 toward your limit.

Both **published** and **scheduled** posts within your current billing period count toward your usage. Drafts do not count.

## Billing period

Your billing period starts on the day you subscribed and renews monthly on the same day. Post usage resets at the start of each billing period.
