Tibbie includes a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that lets AI assistants create posts, manage connections, and upload media on your behalf.

## Why MCP?

Unlike traditional APIs that require you to write code, MCP lets you simply **tell an AI what you want** — and it handles the API calls for you.

> **Example:** Instead of reading API docs and writing curl commands, you can just say: *"Hey Claude, post this article to my X account tomorrow at 9am."*

## Setup

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add tibbie --transport http https://tibbie.co/mcp -- --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tibbie": {
      "url": "https://tibbie.co/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with an API token from your [Access tokens](https://tibbie.co/settings/tokens) settings page.

### Other AI Assistants

MCP is a standard protocol. Any AI assistant that supports MCP can connect to Tibbie:

- **Cursor** — Add to settings > MCP servers
- **Windsurf** — Similar setup to Claude Code
- **OpenAI SDK** — Use the MCP HTTPS transport

## Your first AI-powered post

Once connected, here's how a typical conversation works:

```
You: Hey, can you post this to X? https://example.com/my-new-blog-post

AI: Let me first check which accounts you have connected, then create and publish the post.

[AI calls list-connections to see your connected accounts]

AI: I see you have @yourhandle connected on X. Let me:
1. Upload the featured image
2. Create a draft post
3. Publish it now

[AI calls upload-media, create-post, then publish-post]

Done! Your post is now live on X: https://x.com/yourhandle/status/123456789
```

### What the AI knows

When you connect Tibbie via MCP, the AI can see:

- **Your connected accounts** — Which platforms and handles are linked
- **Your posts** — All drafts, scheduled, and published posts
- **Media library** — Previously uploaded images and videos
- **Account limits** — How many posts you have remaining this billing cycle

The AI **cannot** see your platform passwords or OAuth tokens — those stay secure on Tibbie's servers.

## Available tools

### Posts

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list-posts` | List posts with optional filtering by status, connection, and sort order. |
| `get-post` | Get details of a specific post including platforms, media, and status. |
| `create-post` | Create a new post. Posts are drafts unless `scheduled_at` is provided. Use `"now"` for immediate publishing. |
| `update-post` | Update a draft or scheduled post. |
| `delete-post` | Permanently delete a post and its associated media. |
| `publish-post` | Publish a draft or scheduled post immediately. |

### Connections

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list-connections` | List connected social media accounts, optionally filtered by provider or status. |
| `show-connection` | Get details of a specific connected account. |
| `connect-platform` | Start an OAuth flow to connect a new platform. Returns an authorization URL. |
| `check-connection-status` | Poll the status of an in-progress OAuth connection flow. |
| `disconnect-account` | Disconnect a social media account. |

### Media

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `upload-media` | Upload media from a URL or get a presigned upload URL. Returns a `media_id` to use with `create-post` or `update-post`. |
| `confirm-media-upload` | Confirm a file was uploaded via the presigned URL from `upload-media`. |

### Account

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get-current-user` | Get the authenticated user's profile. |

## Example prompts

Here are some things you can ask your AI assistant:

### Create and publish immediately
> "Post this link to LinkedIn and X: https://yoursite.com/blog/post"

### Schedule for later
> "Schedule this image to Instagram tomorrow at 6pm"

### Check what's scheduled
> "What posts do I have scheduled for this week?"

### Connect a new account
> "Connect my Threads account so I can post from there too"

### Get analytics
> "How many posts have I published this month?"

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused"

The Tibbie MCP server might be down. Check [status.tibbie.co](https://status.tibbie.co) or try again in a few minutes.

### "Unauthorized" errors

Your API token may have expired or been revoked. Generate a new token at [tibbie.co/settings/tokens](https://tibbie.co/settings/tokens) and update your MCP configuration.

### AI doesn't see my connected accounts

Make sure you've connected at least one account in the Tibbie dashboard first. The AI can only see accounts that are already linked — it can't create new connections without your intervention (OAuth requires browser authentication).

## Authentication

The MCP server uses the same Bearer token authentication as the REST API. Create a token in your [Access tokens](https://tibbie.co/settings/tokens) settings.
