Tibbie includes a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that lets AI assistants create posts, manage connections, and upload media on your behalf.

## Setup

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add tibbie --transport http https://tibbie.co/mcp -- --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tibbie": {
      "url": "https://tibbie.co/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with an API token from your [Access tokens](https://tibbie.co/settings/tokens) settings page.
