Get up and running with Tibbie in three steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up at [tibbie.co](https://tibbie.co) with your email, or log in with Google or GitHub. Choose a plan to get started:

    - **Starter** — $12/mo, 200 posts, 10 connected accounts
    - **Growth** — $29/mo, unlimited posts, 20 connected accounts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect a social account">
    Go to **Connections** and click **Connect account**. Select a platform (e.g. X) and authorize Tibbie through the OAuth flow. Once connected, the account appears in your connections list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and publish a post">
    Go to **Posts** and click **New post**. Write your content, select which connected accounts to publish to, and choose an action:

    - **Save as draft** — save without scheduling
    - **Schedule** — pick a date and time for automatic publishing
    - **Publish now** — publish immediately to all selected platforms
  </Step>
