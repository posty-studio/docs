Each social platform enforces its own limits on post content and media. Tibbie validates these limits before publishing so you can fix issues before they cause failures.

## Character limits

| Platform | Standard | Premium |
|---|---|---|
| X (Twitter) | 280 characters | 25,000 characters (X Premium) |

X Premium character limits apply automatically when your connected X account has a verified (blue) subscription.

## Media limits

| Platform | Images | GIF | Video |
|---|---|---|---|
| X (Twitter) | Up to 4 | 1 (exclusive) | 1 (exclusive) |

On X, media types are exclusive — you can attach up to 4 images, or 1 GIF, or 1 video, but you cannot mix types in a single post.

## General media limits

These apply across all platforms:

- **Max file size:** 250 MB
- **Max video duration:** 120 seconds
- **Supported formats:** JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, MP4, MOV

## Daily posting limits

To protect your accounts from being flagged for spam and to respect platform limits, Tibbie enforces safe daily posting limits per each connected account. If you have multiple accounts on the same platform, each gets its own limit.

| Platform | Daily limit |
|---|---|
| X (Twitter) | 20 posts |
| Instagram | 100 posts |
| Facebook | 100 posts |
| Threads | 250 posts |
| Other platforms | 50 posts |

When you reach the daily limit for a connected account, you won't be able to schedule or publish additional posts to that account for the rest of the day. Posts to other connected accounts are not affected.

## Validation

The post composer shows a live character count for each selected platform. If your content exceeds a platform's character limit, you'll see a warning before saving or publishing.

Media validation happens when you publish. If a post violates a platform's media rules (e.g. too many images on X), publishing will fail for that platform with a specific error message.
