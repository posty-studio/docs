Each social platform enforces its own limits on post content and media. Tibbie validates these limits before publishing so you can fix issues before they cause failures.

## Character limits

| Platform | Standard | Premium |
|---|---|---|
| X (Twitter) | 280 characters | 25,000 characters (X Premium) |

X Premium character limits apply automatically when your connected X account has a verified (blue) subscription.

## Media limits

| Platform | Images | GIF | Video |
|---|---|---|---|
| X (Twitter) | Up to 4 | 1 (exclusive) | 1 (exclusive) |

On X, media types are exclusive — you can attach up to 4 images, or 1 GIF, or 1 video, but you cannot mix types in a single post.

## General media limits

These apply across all platforms:

- **Max file size:** 250 MB
- **Max video duration:** 120 seconds
- **Supported formats:** JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, MP4, MOV

## Validation

The post composer shows a live character count for each selected platform. If your content exceeds a platform's character limit, you'll see a warning before saving or publishing.

Media validation happens when you publish. If a post violates a platform's media rules (e.g. too many images on X), publishing will fail for that platform with a specific error message.
