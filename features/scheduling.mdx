description: "Schedule posts for automatic publishing or publish immediately."

Every post in Tibbie follows a lifecycle from creation to publishing. You can save posts as drafts, schedule them for a specific time, or publish immediately.

## Post lifecycle

A post moves through the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Draft** | Post has no scheduled time. It won't be published until you schedule or manually publish it. |
| **Scheduled** | Post has a future publish time. Tibbie will automatically publish it when the time arrives. |
| **Publishing** | The scheduled time has arrived and Tibbie is sending the post to your connected platforms. |
| **Published** | The post has been successfully published to all target platforms. |
| **Failed** | Publishing failed on all target platforms. Check the post details for error information. |

<Note>
  If a post publishes successfully to some platforms but fails on others, it shows as **Published** with failure details on the individual platforms that failed.
</Note>

## Scheduling a post

When creating or editing a post, you can:

- **Save as draft** — keep the post without scheduling it
- **Schedule** — pick a date and time, and Tibbie publishes automatically
- **Publish now** — send the post to all selected platforms immediately

Scheduled posts can be edited or rescheduled at any time before their publish time. Once a post enters the **Publishing** state, it can no longer be modified.

## Editing posts

You can edit a post's content, media, target platforms, and schedule as long as it is in **Draft** or **Scheduled** status. Published and publishing posts cannot be modified.
