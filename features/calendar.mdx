The calendar gives you a monthly overview of all your posts — drafts, scheduled, published, and failed.

## Using the calendar

The calendar view shows posts organized by their scheduled date. Each day displays the posts scheduled for or published on that date, with visual indicators for their status.

- Click a day to open the post composer with that date pre-filled
- Click an existing post to view or edit it
- Filter by connected account to see posts for a specific platform

## Timezones

Scheduled times are displayed in your team's timezone. All scheduling and calendar display uses this timezone for consistency.
