Tibbie supports uploading images and videos to include in your posts.

## Supported formats

| Type | Formats |
|---|---|
| Images | JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP |
| Videos | MP4, MOV |

## Limits

- **Max file size:** 250 MB
- **Max video duration:** 120 seconds

## Per-platform media limits

Each platform has its own rules for media attachments:

### X (Twitter)

- Up to **4 images** per post, OR
- **1 GIF** per post, OR
- **1 video** per post

You cannot mix media types on X. For example, you can't attach 2 images and 1 GIF to the same post.

## Per-platform media

When using [multi-platform publishing](/features/multi-platform), you can attach different media to each platform. This lets you use platform-appropriate dimensions or formats without creating separate posts.

## API and CLI

You can upload media through the [REST API](/api-reference) using the `POST /media` endpoint, or through the [MCP server](/mcp/overview) using the `upload-media` tool. The API supports both direct file uploads and uploading from a URL.
