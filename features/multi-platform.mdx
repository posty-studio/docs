A single post in Tibbie can target multiple connected accounts simultaneously. Each platform can optionally have its own content and media, so you can tailor your message without creating separate posts.

## Selecting platforms

When composing a post, select one or more connected accounts to publish to. The post will be sent to all selected accounts when published.

## Per-platform customization

By default, all platforms receive the same content and media. To customize for a specific platform:

1. Select multiple accounts in the post composer
2. Switch to a specific platform's tab
3. Edit the content or media for that platform

The customized content overrides the base post content only for that platform. Other platforms continue to use the base content.

## Platform-specific behavior

Each platform has its own character limits and media constraints. The post composer shows a live character count for each selected platform. See [Platform limits](/features/platform-limits) for details.

## Partial failures

When a post targets multiple platforms, each platform publishes independently. If one platform fails (e.g. due to a token expiration), the others can still succeed. The post shows as **Published** with failure details on the platforms that encountered errors.

Check the post details to see the status of each platform and retry or reconnect as needed.
